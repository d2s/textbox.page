# textbox.page

Just a simple textbox for pasting text into and editing.

[textbox.page](https://textbox.page)

Sometimes you just need to paste something somewhere. Rather than opening your notepad app or a code editor, go to textbox.page and paste it there.

It has a code mode and writing mode. The code mode supports tabbing.

I'd love it if you would contribute! Keep it to one file (index.html) and no dependencies.

## Deployment

Just run `now --target production`. You'll have to have access to my Now.sh instance, of course.
